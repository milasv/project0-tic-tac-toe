##The Game "Tic Tac Toe"
[My game](https://milasv.github.io/project0-tic-tac-toe/)

###Overview (Languages/Frameworks used)
Used HTML to build 3x3 square block and start js fuction startGame
Used CSS to style design on a page
Used Javascript to manipulate DOM

###Project Description
To understand where to start I had to watch and read a lot of information on web on how to approach the problem as it was very hard to start from scratch.
First step for me was to fill in the squares with "X" or "O" on click and switch turns. Next few steps were to check for all possible winning combinations, display the message who is the winner, show cat image, clear all squares before game starts, etc. Also added random choice of the first move (who starts first) "X" or "O".
The most challenging part was to add the Draw outcome.


###Major Features
Game board renders in the browser
Switch turns between X and O
Randomly selects the first turn
Shows whose next turn is
Visually display who is the winner or show a draw if neither wins
Dancing cat for winner

###List Of Any Known Bugs
Not at this stage as I did only mandatory tasks


###Wishlist/Future features
I would like to add results tracking
Functionality to play with computer
Also want to make flexible choice of block size 4x4, 5x5 (this also require more complex algorithm how to calculate winner, instead of hardcoding all potential combinations)
